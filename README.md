## pharaoh-csharp-vs

To get started, clone the repository and open the `Pharaoh.sln` file with Visual Studio (VS) 2013.
By default, this solution is set up for VS 2013 to enable utilization of the latest technology available.

Older versions of VS are not officially supported by the team.
If for some reason you want to use VS 2010 or 2012, you may do so by changing the `Platform Toolset` setting in the `Library` project to the appropriate version.  
**Do so at your own risk.**
